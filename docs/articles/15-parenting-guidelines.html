<p>Parenting is a long game.</p>
<p>Play to win.</p>
<p>15 high-impact principles for raising emotionally healthy adults:</p>
<p>Parenting success isn’t measured in years.</p>
<p>It’s measured in decades.</p>
<p>20 years in, I’m not ready to say I know what I&#39;m doing.</p>
<p>But I am starting to see the fruit of long-term thinking.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned (so far):</p>
<p>Be Values-Based:</p>
<p>Families need guiding principles that are used as the basis for praise and discipline.</p>
<p>Parents must define them, articulate them, and uphold them.</p>
<p>If you slip and refuse to be accountable to your kids, you undermine them.</p>
<p>Give your kids an internal compass.</p>
<p>Explain Why As Well As What:</p>
<p>“Because I said so” is a means of control, not an act of love.</p>
<p>It&#39;s your job to teach your kids to think for themselves.</p>
<p>Walk them through the logic behind the decisions you make.</p>
<p>Let them poke holes in it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s critical thinking 101.</p>
<p>Elevate Hard Work:</p>
<p>We tell our kids they can do anything in life.</p>
<p>Then subtly teach them they’re only “good” at certain things.</p>
<p>Too much is made over intelligence.</p>
<p>Work beats intellect.</p>
<p>Grit overcomes ability.</p>
<p>Make this connection for them.</p>
<p>When They Need Help, Wait:</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to see your kids struggle.</p>
<p>Your first instinct is to jump in and help.</p>
<p>Resist this urge.</p>
<p>Parents who help too much raise helpless kids.</p>
<p>Give your child time to work out their own problems.</p>
<p>Support, but don’t coddle.</p>
<p>Reward Effort Over Outcomes:</p>
<p>Results-based parenting sets our kids up for failure.</p>
<p>I want to raise kids who give their full effort to everything they do.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn&#39;t produce the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Whether it’s at school or working around the home, demand full effort.</p>
<p>Praise Risk Taking:</p>
<p>Many parents try to shield their kids from taking risks.</p>
<p>This is well-intentioned - you want to protect them - but a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Risk-taking is a muscle.</p>
<p>Kids must exercise it from an early age.</p>
<p>Or they become fearful, risk-averse adults.</p>
<p>Privately Correct:</p>
<p>The most vulnerable moment in the life of a child is when they&#39;ve messed up.</p>
<p>My biggest moments of failure came from my reaction.</p>
<p>I shamed them publicly. It was damaging.</p>
<p>So much is up for grabs when they fail.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t compound it by humiliating them.</p>
<p>Publicly Correct Course:</p>
<p>One of the most powerful things you can do as a parent is to admit you were wrong.</p>
<p>It&#39;s good for your kids to see you as fallible,</p>
<p>But it&#39;s absolutely critical that they learn how to take ownership of mistakes.</p>
<p>Show them how it&#39;s done.</p>
<p>Be Affectionate From The Start:</p>
<p>The most common compliment I receive about my family ⏤</p>
<p>We&#39;re physically affectionate with one another.</p>
<p>Humans need physical touch.</p>
<p>It is a powerful component in bonding,  relational development, and mental health.</p>
<p>Hug early and often.</p>
<p>Celebrate Success Carefully:</p>
<p>Performance-based love takes hold when kids only receive approval when they win.</p>
<p>It raises little people-pleasing machines.</p>
<p>I want my kids to achieve for the right reasons. For them, not me.</p>
<p>Celebrate who they are not just what they accomplish.</p>
<p>Call B.S.:</p>
<p>I spent years working with high school students vocationally.</p>
<p>I told parents:</p>
<p>If your kid is talking, you&#39;re getting worked.</p>
<p>Kids play angles and present selective information.</p>
<p>Challenging their perspective teaches them how to refine arguments and sell ideas.</p>
<p>Be Quick To Repair:</p>
<p>Failing as a parent is inevitable.</p>
<p>Everyone does. You lose your cool. You overreact. You say things you regret.</p>
<p>So few parents take the time to repair it.</p>
<p>A few words of genuine apology from a parent can undo so many wrongs.</p>
<p>It models humility.</p>
<p>Preach Strength:</p>
<p>We have a rule in our house:
“We Are Morris’ – We Do Hard Things.”</p>
<p>From homework to sports, this refrain is preached over and over again.</p>
<p>Your kids need your resounding voice of belief.</p>
<p>See their strength. Call it out.</p>
<p>Teach Context:</p>
<p>Almost everything in life has a setting where it can be experienced and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Driving at 16 is good. Driving at 6 isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Desert is good, but not if it&#39;s all you eat.</p>
<p>Teach your kids to put things in their proper place.</p>
<p>Context is king.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t Overfunction:</p>
<p>I had a friend whose mother picked out his clothes each day.</p>
<p>All the way through college.</p>
<p>Overfunctioning happens when parents do things for their children they should be doing for themselves.</p>
<p>It hinders their development.</p>
<p>You feel good. They lose.</p>
