# Joshua T Kalis - Articles

**I made a blog!**

Does the world need another platform for displaying web content... sure, why not? So I did.

# Installing

    $ git clone <repository>
    $ npm install
    $ node server.js

# Contributing

Please Help! I could use all the help possible. Contact me if you are interested and we can talk about what you would like to work on to make sure that it is consistent with the philosophy of the project; namely **simple**.

## Process

  1. Fork the repository
  2. Do work
  3. Submit a Pull Request
  4. Repeat

# TODO

I still have a few things I need to do before I can consider this to be done.

  - Badges in footer to give props
    - Devtroit (most important!)
    - NodeJS
    - Marked / Markdown
    - Swig (templating)
    - jQuery
    - Normalize.css
  - Post-push deploy hook (maybe?)
  - Name and Publish npm package for server (maybe?)
  - Convert to Sass for styling
