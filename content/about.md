The teams I lead quickly become great teams, setting the pace and example for others. Great teams are more than simply a group of people working on similar projects. Great teams require purpose, intention, and a shared vision of success. Great teams have common goals and practices that are well known and followed. I build great teams made up of people who respect each other, solve hard problems together, and support and challenge one another.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are important to me therefore they are considerations I keep in mind constantly when building or growing a team. Different viewpoints are important to the success of the team, company, and community. Variety is the spice of life, it is also a recipe for success. No one should feel minimized in any pursuit of success and everyone should feel safe being themself. The world is not a perfect place, and not everyone has the same vision of what perfect even is, so we all need to help make it better through candid communication and collaboration.
