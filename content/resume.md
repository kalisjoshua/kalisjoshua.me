#### Engineering Manager

I enjoy helping people. As a leader, I have had the opportunity to help more people and the responsibility to do so at a much more impactful level than I did as an individual contributor. I empower people to advance their careers technically and socially.

I arranged an infrastructure rebuild in a new region as the first step toward a multi-region conclusion. I was instrumental in leveraging both good communication and strong collaboration across various technology teams.

I was responsible for the Site Reliability Engineers of all commercial client and partner facing digital storefronts, and third-party lead-buy integrations. Our clients were able to shop for, start, close, and manage the servicing of their mortgages on either the web or mobile apps as a result of the efforts of my team.
