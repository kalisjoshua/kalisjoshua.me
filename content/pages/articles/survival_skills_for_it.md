## Survival Skills for IT Weekend
### 18 Feb 2014

What good is it if you have the materials but not the expertise?

### Beginner Survival Weekend

Let's start a tradition. Super simple. A small group of people get together for a relaxing weekend of learning and teaching various survival skills. Some skills might be:

  + Fire-starting
    - Bow-drill
    - Flint and steel
    - Plow
    - Other modern tools
  + Cooking and food storage (preparing food for later)
  + Mini survival kit assembly
    - How small can it be and still be effective
    - What is most important for general scenario
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_survival_kit
  + What is it like to hike with a burdened pack on your back
    - How heavy is you bug-out bag and can you carry it
    - How much stuff do you absolutely need in an emergency
  + Water purification techniques
    - Iodine
    - Charcoal tablets
    - Purification straw
  + First aid
  + Navigation by:
    - Compass
    - Sun
    - Stars
    - Landmarks
  + Priorities when on the run; assessing the situation; scenarios
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism
  + Keeping the mind active and on task
  + Crafting for survival
    - Cordage
    - Nets
    - Traps
    - Baskets
  + Shelter
    - *I put this on here just to acknowledge it for now. I don't think that we should attempt to tear up the trees and all start making shelters that we don't even want to use. If this whole thing becomes a success and we decide to address this I think that we could come up with a plan for it.*

*More skills can be identified at any time; these are just something to start us out.*

I'm not suggesting that we will be able to cover all, or even a majority, of these in a single weekend. I think it would be cool to pick just a few and tackle them together and exercise our skills a few times so that we gain some competence. The theme that inspired me to propose this is, "what good is it if you have the materials but not the expertise".
