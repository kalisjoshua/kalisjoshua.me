## Syllabus 2015
### 31 Dec 2014

So this year, I am a little less ambitious with the breadth of topics I would
like to focus on; but possibly (hopefully) more accurate.

  * REST
  * Presentations
  * JavaScript
  * Personal website (always)

### REST

I've been getting into and learning about the REST architectural style lately.
We've been moving in that direction more and more; I think this coming year is
going the be the year of REST.

I have been looking for new challenges to solve in REST and why one approach is
better than others. Slowly, I have been developing a small curriculum for
learning/teaching best practices.

### Presentations

I have given some presentations in the past but I definitely think that I could
have delivered the content better. This year I would like to focus on giving
better presentations.

#### How...?

  1. Less content on slides, more delivery by myself
  2. More focused on experience
  3. Better conversation during the presentation; more questions to the audience

### JavaScript

I have been looking to change career focus. I almost made a switch to Erlang for
a project that was starting up at work but got put on hold. JavaScript will
probably always be my most native programming language so I commit to continue
to be a member of the community and participating in development.

### Personal Website

My personal website(s) needs some TLC for sure. Luckily I am in a professional
position where I don't need to promote myself to employers as a candidate for
hire but I would like to have a better online presence.
