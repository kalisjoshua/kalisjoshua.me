### The Holy Grail

The loss of any one *software engineer* is easily remedied with addition of another.

## It never goes this smoothly.

The problem is not that one of these two people are better, but that there are differences between them.

### Choose Your (Our) Own Adventure

We have a few paths that we can travel to explore the reasons why **'Fungible Engineers'** is a myth, which should we take?

  1. Economical
  2. Philosophical
  3. Metaphorical

## Economical

## Philosophical

---

## Metaphorical

Do you want an electrical engineer designing the structural components of a large building? Or would a structural engineer be better suited to the job?

---

## Difference Is Good!

---

### Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous

Both are good but they are orthogonal to each other; you cannot have both.

---

You say that you want engineers that are interchangeable. I say that you do not. Design by committee is a
recipe to not change the status quo and continue to produce what has been produced in the past. Creativity
is the work of few and unique people. Foster that creativity - that innovative spirit - by encouraging
them to continue. Do not suppress them with the idea that they can not be successful on their own.
