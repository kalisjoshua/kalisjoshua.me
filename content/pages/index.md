I've spent 20+ years building teams and shipping high-impact software. At Rocket Mortgage, I led frontend development for Warren Buffett's Billion Dollar Bracket, built their first SRE team from scratch achieving 99.99% uptime, and worked on systems supporting over $100 billion in closed loans. More recently, I've been transforming engineering quality and culture, like taking test coverage from 0 to 80% in 8 months while building high-performing teams that people want to join.
