Technology leader, deeply passionate about fostering great teams to solve challenging problems under a shared vision and common goals. Proven ability to deliver mission-critical, high-profile projects on tight deadlines. Diversity and inclusion champion, skilled in developing healthy organizations built on mutual respect, transparency, and candid communication.

<!-- The teams I lead quickly become great teams, setting the pace and example for others. Great teams are more than simply a group of people working on similar projects. Great teams require purpose, intention, and a shared vision of success. Great teams have common goals and practices that are well known and followed. I build great teams composed of people who respect each other, solve tough problems, and support and challenge one another. -->

<!-- Diversity, equity, and inclusion are constant considerations I keep in mind when building or growing a team. No one should feel minimized in any pursuit of success, and everyone should feel safe being themself. The world is not perfect, and not everyone has the same vision of what perfect is. We can all help make it better through honest and candid collaborative communication. -->
