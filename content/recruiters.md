### Recruiter, please take notice!

I am not currently looking to entertain any new employment at this time. I appreciate that you think that you know the perfect position for me, but you truly don't. I would really enjoy not having to ask you to never contact me again about some 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, or more month non-JavaScript developer position anywhere in the world.

I will contact the companies that I am interested in, on my own. I am plenty capable of speaking with my future employers on my own and deciding what is the correct decision for my situation.

<!--
I will not commute longer than 30 minutes from home to work; I will ask for relocation expenses. I require full admin rights on the MacBook pro I am issued. I will need a the latest Apple Cinema display. A sit/stand desk will also be required when I am in the office.

Thank you for your time. If we meet or are in contact please make reference to this so that we can have a laugh.
