### Introduction

  + Joshua T Kalis
    - I do cool things; *at least I like to think so*.

---

### Presentation Goals

  1. The problem-space luxui is attempting to address
  2. How luxui is solving the problems of an admin UI for an API in Phony
  3. Profit (always profit)
  4. (Attempt to) Come to consensus on if we (QL) would like to adopt the strategy of luxui

---

## Presentation Goal #1

The problem-space of luxui.

---

### Internal Applications

  1. We Have a lot of internal applications.
  2. Many of them need UIs.
  3. The UIs don't provide business value; a.k.a. they don't make us money *directly*.

---

## My Solution

**Stop** making customized UIs for these applications.

---

## luxui Goals

Truly reusable frontend application; and application components

---

## luxui Goals

Completely decoupled frontend (UI) and backend (API)

---

## luxui Goals

Enable non-UI-engineers to focus on non-UI-related features and tasks

---

## luxui Goals

Empower UI-engineers to have control of the UIs of our internal applications

---

## luxui Goals

Make our internal applications UIs have a consistent UX

---

### Consistent UX

  - Easier training on new applications; either as:
    * Truly new applications, or
    * A team member is new to an existing application

---

## luxui Goals

Faster, more consistent, more secure changes, and updates, to application UIs

---

## luxui Goals

Reinforce RESTful best practices

---

## Presentation Goal #2
