## APIStrat 2016 (Boston)

---

## Boston is awesome.

---

## Inspiration

Every time I go to an API conference I get inspired.

---

## Topics

---

### Topics

  1. Empathy
  2. Vision
  3. Responsibility
  4. Other Stuff

---

## Empathy

---

## Empathy

Be considerate of the API consumers.

---

## Empathy

  > "Consider the client; the consumers of APIs should be at the forefront of
  > planning and development rather than an afterthought."

---

## Empathy

  > "Just because you are correct doesn't mean that I am wrong. You just aren't seeing things from my perspective."

---

## Empathy

How the API is being supported: documentation, SDKs and libraries, usage
patterns, change notices, maintenance schedules.

---

## The Goal

_Delight_ the developers.

---

## Vision

---

## Vision

Keep in mind the larger picture; don't get lost in the details.

---

### Questions to answer

  - How will the API fit into the existing ecosystem?
  - How will the ecosystem respond to an additional API?
  - Who will maintain the higher view and who will dive into the minutiae?
  - How will new APIs affect SLAs?

---

## Responsibility

---

## Responsibility

Do not be ignorant of where data is being stored.

---

## Responsibility

We should focus on making the lives of our fellow humans better.

---

### Other Stuff

  - API tokens tied to a version of the API; upgrades are explicit
  - Schedule "blackout" testing - when preparing to deprecate functionality
  to prove early-adopters are ok
  - Oracle v Google was a silly court case
  - Communication is hard! Understanding is necessary for transformation
  - Hypermedia still hasn't become widespread; because:
    + Hypermedia is complex
    + Tooling is lacking
