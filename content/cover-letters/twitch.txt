Dear Twitch,

I want to contribute to the success of Twitch as a brand, platform, and product; because I believe in the possibilities it offers. I personally have used Twitch to broadcast our gender reveal party to family and friends who were unable to attend. I want to support and grow healthy work environments because the world needs more, both in quantity and quality, inclusive and collaborative teams.

I found the listing for Engineering Manager to be aligned with my experience, passion, and values. I have watched a number of streamers who have complained about 3rd party tooling integration and definitely think that I could help Twitch develop tools for streamers.

I would greatly appreciate discussing how I could join the team and help deliver some amazing results. I look forward to our conversation.
