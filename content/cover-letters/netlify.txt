Dear Netlify,

I found the Netlify listing for Senior Developer Tooling Engineer (Node) to be aligned with my experience, passion, and values. In doing some research about the company I have been truly impressed with the product and vision the company has. I think that I could be an asset in achieving the goals the team has. I have been working in JavaScript projects since UglifyJS and Prototype we the leading edge of the development. I think the ecosystem is seeing a huge uptick in the available solutions and the quality of those solutions is also growing.

I haven't been a tooling engineer in my past but I know that I can hit the ground running and level up quickly. I know the NodeJS and npm ecosystem pretty well and I am a good collaborator. I have evangelized the tenets of open source software within the enterprises I've worked in to help federate development across teams and help bring people together through work.

I would greatly appreciate discussing how I could join the team and help deliver some amazing results.
