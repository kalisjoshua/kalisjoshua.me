Dear GitHub,

I want to contribute to the success of GitHub as a brand, platform, and product; because I believe in the possibilities it offers. I want to support and grow healthy work environments both internally (i.e. GitHub) and externally (i.e. open source communities) because the world needs more inclusive and collaborative groups working together towards positive outcomes.

I want to give back to a company that has provided immeasurable personal and professional value. I have used GitHub for many years and have brought others along with me because I believe in the platform and the value it provides; I see great potential for inclusion and transparency beyond just software repositories. Collaborative software development is an obvious use case but more generally it can be used for sharing ideas, gathering feedback, organizing vision and goals, building trust, encouraging communication, growing communities, education, and many other possibilities.

I believe that GitHub has transformed how software is developed, beyond just what Git itself enables; GitHub has lowered the barrier of entry and expanded the landscape of possibility for countless people and communities. I have collaborated on the building of educational courses for people getting started with GitHub, both programmers and non-programmers, so that they can be a part of their team's process. I personally use GitHub as a platform for various projects because of how easy it is to use and maintain; I would love to be a part of the team that is making a tool I use even better.
