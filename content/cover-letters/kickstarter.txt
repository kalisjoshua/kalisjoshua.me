Dear Kickstarter,

I want to contribute to the success of Kickstarter as a brand and platform because I believe in the possibilities it offers. I want to support and grow healthy work environments because the world needs more, both in quantity and quality, inclusive and collaborative teams.

I found the listing for Engineering Manager to be aligned with my experience, passion, and values. I have a background in software development and still enjoy side projects augmenting my responsibilities as a people leader. I would love to have a position where my talents as a coder can be leveraged to help push the product forward and help the team.

I would greatly appreciate discussing how I could join the team and help deliver some amazing results. I look forward to our conversation.
