Dear Mozilla,

I want to contribute to the success of Mozilla. I want to support and grow healthy work environments because the world needs more inclusive and collaborative groups working together towards positive outcomes.

I believe in the brand and product Mozilla produces and I want to help improve Privacy and Security for everyone. As our lives move more and more into the digital realm more effort will continually be needed to help people live their best possible lives safely and with as much control as they can get. Abstaining from digital life is an option but not one that many are willing to accept the ramifications of so better tooling that makes good choices easier is needed.
